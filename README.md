# Art-Gallery-Management
Online Art Gallery is an e-commerce application software that helps the customers to search for their arts and paintings as well as can place order for the selected pieces. The user can also get information about the art exhibition so they can visit those exhibitions.
There will be two types of userâ€™s roles in the website, the first one is the customer who can search and discover the art. If they want to buy any art they have to register and login to buy the art.
The second one is the admin who has to login to post the artworks of the artist for exhibiting and selling on the website. The admin also specifies authority and restrictions on the users. He looks into the feedback of the customer and accounts of the artworks sold.

Here are few pictures of the website
